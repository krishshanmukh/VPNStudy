Pinging the VPN server involed with and without VPN:
While the VPN service uses UDP, the performance is comparable between the 2 in terms of ping time.
traceroute looks identical with more servers responding when we don't use VPNs.

Even when the VPN uses TCP for communication between the VPN client and the server, the average ping time is approximately the same, with only a small increase when compared to the case where UDP was used.
